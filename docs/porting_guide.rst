Porting GuideLine
=================

The OpenAMP Framework uses libmetal to provide abstractions that allow for porting of the OpenAMP Framework to various software environments (operating systems and bare metal environments) and machines (processors/platforms). To port OpenAMP for your platform, you will need to:

    - add your system environment support to libmetal,
    - implement your platform specific remoteproc driver.
    - define your shared memory layout and specify it in a resource table.

**************************************
Add System/Machine Support in Libmetal
**************************************

User will need to add system/machine support to lib/system/<SYS>/ directory in libmetal repository. OpenAMP requires the following libmetal primitives:

    - alloc, for memory allocation and memory free
    - io, for memory mapping. OpenAMP required memory mapping in order to access vrings and carved out memory.
    - mutex
    - sleep, at the moment, OpenAMP only requires microseconds sleep as when OpenAMP fails to get a buffer to send messages, it will call this function to sleep and then try again.
    - init, for libmetal initialization.

Please refer to lib/system/generic/ when adding RTOS support to libmetal.

libmetal uses C11/C++11 stdatomics interface for atomic operations, if you use a different compiler to GNU gcc, you may need to implement the atomic operations defined in lib/compiler/gcc/atomic.h.

***********************************
Platform Specific Remoteproc Driver
***********************************

User will need to implement platform specific remoteproc driver to use remoteproc life cycle management APIs. The remoteproc driver platform specific functions are defined in this file: lib/include/openamp/remoteproc.h. Here are the remoteproc functions needs platform specific implementation.

    - init(), instantiate the remoteproc instance with platform specific config parameters.
    - remove(), destroy the remoteproc instance and its resource.
    - mmap(), map the memory speficified with physical address or remote device address so that it can be used by the application.
    - handle_rsc(), handler to the platform specific resource which is specified in the resource table.
    - config(), configure the remote processor to get it ready to load application.
    - start(), start the remote processor to run the application.
    - stop(), stop the remote processor from running but not power it down.
    - shutdown(), shutdown the remote processor and you can power it down.
    - notify(), notify the remote processor.

**********************************************************************
Platform Specific Porting to Use Remoteproc to Manage Remote Processor
**********************************************************************

User will need to implement the above platform specific remoteproc driver functions. After that, user can use remoteproc APIs to run application on a remote processor. E.g.:

::

  #include <openamp/remoteproc.h>

  /* User defined remoteproc operations */
  extern struct remoteproc_ops rproc_ops;

  /* User defined image store operations, such as open the image file, read
   * image from storage, and close the image file.
   */

  extern struct image_store_ops img_store_ops;
  /* Pointer to keep the image store information. It will be passed to user
   * defined image store operations by the remoteproc loading application
   * function. Its structure is defined by user.
   */
  void *img_store_info;

  struct remoteproc rproc;

  void main(void)
  {
	/* Instantiate the remoteproc instance */
	remoteproc_init(&rproc, &rproc_ops, &private_data);

	/* Optional, required, if user needs to configure the remote before
	 * loading applications.
	 */
	remoteproc_config(&rproc, &platform_config);

	/* Load Application. It only supports ELF for now. */
	remoteproc_load(&rproc, img_path, img_store_info, &img_store_ops, NULL);

	/* Start the processor to run the application. */
	remoteproc_start(&rproc);

	/* ... */

	/* Optional. Stop the processor, but the processor is not powered
	 * down.
	 */
	remoteproc_stop(&rproc);

	/* Shutdown the processor. The processor is supposed to be powered
	 * down.
	 */
	remoteproc_shutdown(&rproc);

	/* Destroy the remoteproc instance */
	remoteproc_remove(&rproc);
  }

**************************************
Platform Specific Porting to Use RPMsg
**************************************

RPMsg in OpenAMP implementation uses VirtIO to manage the shared buffers. OpenAMP library provides remoteproc VirtIO backend implementation. You don't have to use remoteproc backend. You can implement your VirtIO backend with the VirtIO and RPMsg implementation in OpenAMP. If you want to implement your own VirtIO backend, you can refer to the [remoteproc VirtIO backend implementation]: https://github.com/OpenAMP/open-amp/blob/master/lib/remoteproc/remoteproc_virtio.c

Here are the steps to use OpenAMP for RPMsg communication:

::

  #include <openamp/remoteproc.h>
  #include <openamp/rpmsg.h>
  #include <openamp/rpmsg_virtio.h>

  /* User defined remoteproc operations for communication */
  sturct remoteproc rproc_ops = {
	.init = local_rproc_init;
	.mmap = local_rproc_mmap;
	.notify = local_rproc_notify;
	.remove = local_rproc_remove;
  };

  /* Remoteproc instance. If you don't use Remoteproc VirtIO backend,
   * you don't need to define the remoteproc instance.
   */
  struct remoteproc rproc;

  /* RPMsg VirtIO device instance. */
  struct rpmsg_virtio_device rpmsg_vdev;

  /* RPMsg device */
  struct rpmsg_device *rpmsg_dev;

  /* Resource Table. Resource table is used by remoteproc to describe
   * the shared resources such as vdev(VirtIO device) and other shared memory.
   * Resource table resources definition is in the remoteproc.h.
   * Examples of the resource table can be found in the OpenAMP repo:
   *  - apps/machine/zynqmp/rsc_table.c
   *  - apps/machine/zynqmp_r5/rsc_table.c
   *  - apps/machine/zynq7/rsc_table.c
   */
  void *rsc_table = &resource_table;

  /* Size of the resource table */
  int rsc_size = sizeof(resource_table);

  /* Shared memory metal I/O region. It will be used by OpenAMP library
   * to access the memory. You can have more than one shared memory regions
   * in your application.
   */
  struct metal_io_region *shm_io;

  /* VirtIO device */
  struct virtio_device *vdev;

  /* RPMsg shared buffers pool */
  struct rpmsg_virtio_shm_pool shpool;

  struct rpmsg_endpoint ept;

  /* User defined RPMsg name service callback. This callback is called
   * when there is no registered RPMsg endpoint is found for this name
   * service. User can create RPMsg endpoint in this callback. */
  void ns_bind_cb(struct rpmsg_device *rdev, const char *name, uint32_t dest);

  /* User defined RPMsg endpoint received message callback */

	/* Mmap shared memories so that they can be used */
	remoteproc_mmap(&rproc, &physical_address, NULL, size,
			<memory_attributes>, &shm_io);

	/* Parse resource table to remoteproc */
	remoteproc_set_rsc_table(&rproc, rsc_table, rsc_size);

	/* Create VirtIO device from remoteproc.

	 */
	vdev = remoteproc_create_virtio(&rproc, 0, VIRTIO_DEV_MASTER, NULL);

	 * side set the VirtIO device DRIVER OK status bit.

	/* Get RPMsg device from RPMsg VirtIO device */
	rpmsg_dev = rpmsg_virtio_get_rpmsg_device(&rpmsg_vdev);

	rpmsg_create_ept(&ept, rdev, RPMSG_SERVICE_NAME, RPMSG_ADDR_ANY,

		rproc_virtio_notified(vdev, RSC_NOTIFY_ID_ANY);
