System Wide Considerations
==========================

AMP systems could either be supervised (using a hypervisor to enforce isolation and resource
virtualization) or unsupervised (modifying each participating software context to ensure best-
effort isolation and cooperative usage of shared resources). With unsupervised AMP systems, there is
no strict isolation or supervision of shared resource usage.

Take the following system-wide considerations into account to develop unsupervised AMP systems
using the OpenAMP framework.

   - Determine system :ref:`architecture/topology<topology-work-label>`

   The OpenAMP framework implicitly assumes a host controller to remote system architecture. The
   topology for this architecture should be determined; either star, chain, or a combination. The
   following figure shows some simple use cases.

      * Case 1 — A single host controller software context on processor 1 controlling life cycle and
        communicating with two independent remote software contexts on processors 2 and 3, in star
        topology,

      * Case 2 — Host controller software context 1 on processor 1 brings up remote software
        context 1 on processor 2. This context acts as the host software context 2 for remote
        software context 2 on processor 3, in chain topology.

   - Determine system and IO resource partitioning

   Various OSs, RTOSs, and bare metal environments have their own preferred mechanisms for
   discovering platform-specific information such as available RAM memory, available peripheral IO
   resources (their memory-mapped IO region), clocks, interrupt resources, and so forth.

   For example, the Linux kernel uses device trees and bare metal environment typically define
   platform-specific device information in headers or dedicated data structures that would be
   compiled into the application.

   To ensure mutually-exclusive usage of unshared system (memory) and IO resources (peripherals)
   between the participating software environments in an AMP system, you are required to partition
   the resources so that each software environment is only aware of the resources that are available
   to it. This would involve, for example, removing unused resource nodes and modifying the
   available memory definitions from the device tree sources, platform definition files, headers,
   and so forth, to ensure best-effort partitioning of system resources.

   - Determine memory layout

   For the purpose of this description, assume you are using the Zynq SOC used in AMP system
   architecture with SMP Linux running on the dual Cortex A9 cores, and a RTOS on one instance of
   Microblaze soft core, and bare metal on another instance of Microblaze soft core in the fabric.

   To develop an AMP system using the OpenAMP Framework, it is important to determine the memory
   regions that would be owned and shared between each of the participating software environments in
   the AMP system. For example, in a configuration such as this, the memory address ranges owned
   (for code/data/bss/heap) by each participating OS or bare metal context, and the shared memory
   regions to be used by IPC mechanisms (virtio rings and memory for data buffers) need to be
   determined. Memory alignment requirements should be taken into consideration while making this
   determination.

   The following image illustrates the memory layout for Linux host/RTOS-based remote application,
   and RTOS-based host/bare metal-based remote application in chain configuration.

   - Ensure cooperative usage of shared resources between software environments in the AMP system

   For the purpose of this discussion, assume you are using a Linux host/bare metal- based remote
   system configuration.

   The interrupt controller is typically a shared resource in multicore SoCs. It is general practice
   for OSs to reset and initialize (clear and disable all interrupts) the interrupt controller
   during their boot sequence given the general assumption that the OS would own the entire system.
   This will not work in AMP systems; if an OS in remote software context resets and initializes the
   interrupt controller, it would catastrophically break the host controller software context's
   runtime since the host context could already be using the interrupt controller to manage its
   interrupt resources. Therefore, remote software environments should be patched such that they
   cooperatively use the interrupt controller (for example, do not reset/clear/disable all
   interrupts blindly but initialize only the interrupts that belong to the remote context). Ensure
   the timer peripheral used by the remote OS/RTOS context is different from the one used by the
   host controller software context so the individual runtimes do not interfere with each other.
