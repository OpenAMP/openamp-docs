Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP) Intro
======================================

An embedded AMP system is characterized by multiple homogeneous and/or heterogeneous processing
cores integrated into one System-on-a-Chip (SoC). Examples include:

    - The AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs that utilize four ARM Cortex-A53, two ARM Cortex-R5, and
      potentially a number of MicroBlaze cores.
    - The NXP i.MX6SoloX/i.MX7d SoCs that utilize ARM Cortex-A9 and ARM Cortex-M4F cores
    - The Texas Instruments Sitara AM625 SoCs that utilize ARM Cortex-A53, ARM Cortex-M4F, ARM
      Cortex-R5F, and PRU-ICSS cores.
    - The ST STM32MP15x SoCs that utilize ARM Cortex-A7 and ARM Cortex-M4 cores.

These cores typically run independent instances of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous software
environments, such as Linux, RTOS, and Bare Metal that work together to achieve the design goals of
the end application. While Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) operating systems allow load balancing
of application workload across homogeneous processors present in such AMP SoCs, asymmetric
multiprocessing design paradigms are required to leverage parallelism from the heterogeneous cores
present in the system.

Increasingly, todayâ€™s multicore applications require heterogeneous processing power. Heterogeneous
multicore SoCs often have one or more general purpose CPUs (for example, ARM Cortex-A cores) with
DSPs (such as TI C7x cores) and/or smaller CPUs (such as ARM Cortex-M and Cortex-R cores) and/or
soft IP (such as AMD MicroBlaze cores). These specialized CPUs, as compared to the general purpose
CPUs, are typically dedicated for demand-driven offload of specialized application functionality to
achieve maximum system performance. Systems developed using these types of SoCs, characterized by
heterogeneity in both hardware and software, are generally termed as AMP systems.

Other reasons to run heterogeneous software environments (e.g. multi-OS) include:

    - Needs for multiple environments with different characteristics
        * Real-time (RTOS) and general purpose (i.e. Linux)
        * Safe/Secure environment and regular environment
        * GPL and non-GPL environments
    - Integration of code written for multiple environments
        * Legacy OS and new OS

In AMP systems, it is typical for software running on a host to bring up software/firmware contexts
on a remote on a demand-driven basis and communicate with them using IPC mechanisms to offload work
during runtime. The participating host and remote processors may be homogeneous or heterogeneous in
nature. The remote can also be started automatically, on boot, which may be required where the
remote is part of a safety critical system.

A host is defined as the CPU/software that is booted first and is responsible for managing other
CPUs and their software contexts present in an AMP system. A remote is defined as the CPU/software
context managed by the host software context present.
